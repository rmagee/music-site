# Music Site
A very-simple, customizable music website.

## Before you Start

### Prerequisites
You will need some very-basic JavaScript and CSS skills.  If you plan on deploying by yourself, you will 
also need basic web site deployment skills.  This site can be deployed on any webserver.  

### Vercel Deployment Options
Since this site was developed using Next.js you can also deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) as a hobby site for free or for 20-dollars a 
month (at the time of this writing) for a pro membership.

## Getting Started

Before you do anything, run the development server- this will hot update as you make changes described below:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site.

## Step 1. Customizing the Background Images

There are three background images for the main three pages in the _/public/images_ folder:

- home.jpg - this is the home screen banner image
- music.jpg - this is the background image for the music list
- bio.jpg - this is the main banner image on the biography site

## Step 2. Customize the Color Theme

This site uses MUI theming (formerly Material UI theming) for the primary and secondary colors as 
well as for typography.  The main theme is in the _/lib/theme.js_ file and is easy to modify.  

### Using the Theme Creator

If you do not know CSS and/or are uncomfortable editing the theme by hand.  Try using the 
[Material-UI Theme Creator](https://bareynol.github.io/mui-theme-creator/) to generate your own.  Keep in mind
that the code generated by the theme creator **is in TYPESCRIPT (this site is in JavaScript) so you will need to remove the** 
`export const themeOptions: ThemeOptions` and replace it with `export const theme`

## Step 3. Add Music

### Add songs to the music folder.

To add your own music, first upload it somewhere where it can be accessed via URL- the music folder is provided
as part of this site but as long as the URL is accessible by the media player embedded in the *music* page
the audio will play.  

## Step 4. Add Song Info
The final step is to add the song information to the _songs.json file.  Each song added to this file will 
appear in the list of songs to be played on the music page.  **The development server will need to be restarted
for these changes to take effect.**

### Edit the _/data/songs.json_ file.

Next, edit the _data/songs.js_ file.  It is in the following example format:

    [
        {
        "title": "My Hit Song",
        "url": "/music/My Hit Song.mp3"
        },
        {
        "title": "My B-Side",
        "url": "/music/My B-Side.mp3"
    }

## Step 5. Modify the bio.txt File
The text on the biography page is taken from the _/data/bio.txt_ file.  This is just a plain-old text file.
Put whatever biography info you want to appear below the bio picture here and it will be rendered on the 
bio page.

## Step 6.  Modify the Footer
The footer contains text relative to copyright information, etc.  This can be modified in the _/components/footer.js_
file.
